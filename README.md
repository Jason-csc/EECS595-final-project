# EECS595-final-project: Exploring LSTM Networks Approach on TRIP Dataset
#### A NLP system to determine whether the given story is plausible and identify sentences causing conflicts on TRIP dataset <https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04947>
#### The goal is to explore the reasoning process of large pretrained language models compared to their end performance
#### All training code is avaliable in *TieredReasoning_System.ipynb*. Relevant result and discussions are shown in *finalreport.pdf*
